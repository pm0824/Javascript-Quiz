1. What is JavaScript?
JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.

Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run.

2. Why is it called JavaScript?
When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name: “LiveScript”. But Java was very popular at that time, so it was decided that positioning a new language as a “younger brother” of Java would help.

But as it evolved, JavaScript became a fully independent language with its own specification called ECMAScript, and now it has no relation to Java at all.

Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, or actually on any device that has a special program called the JavaScript engine.

Here I have developed the basic quiz system using Javascript.
